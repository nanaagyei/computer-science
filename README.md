# Computer Science Learning Journey

Welcome to my Computer Science and Software Engineering learning repository! This is where I document my journey, store projects, and collect resources as I develop my skills in computer science and software engineering.

## 🎯 Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A portfolio of my programming projects
- A collection of solved coding problems and exercises (found in another repository [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.github.com/nanaagyei/dsa.git))
- A knowledge base of computer science concepts
- A resource hub for learning materials
